The address to the function that checks if the input corrispond to the actual password 
is in 0x80001ac.

This function checks that each char of the guessed password is equal to
some saved pwd ^ 0x4d.

FUNCTION:

int32_t check_password(char* guessed_pwd, char* real_pwd)
  char* guessed_pwd = guessed_pwd
  char* real_pwd = real_pwd
  int32_t i = 0

  while (*guessed_pwd != 0)
      if (*guessed_pwd == (*real_pwd ^ 0x4d))
          i += 1

      guessed_pwd = &guessed_pwd[1]
      real_pwd = &real_pwd[1]

  if (i != 4)
      return 1

  return 0

So to retrieve the password we have to check the assembly code 
where we can see that password = /""9
So, now doing "chr(ord(i) ^ 0x4d)" on each char i of the saved password
we can recover the actual password "boot"
